This tutorial was created as a final project for an MIT class (6.859, Spring 2021). The files, write-up, and animations were created by Aik Jun Tan, Franklin Morgan, and Daniel Schwalbe-Koda. This fork uses the original work for academic presentations. The original Github repo can be seen on [this link](https://github.com/6859-sp21/final-project-atomistic-uncertainty).
